PYTHON IMPS:
Randint takes 2 arguments in which it includes both max and min value
randrange takes 2 argument in which it takes only min value not the max one
both requires two argument
random.random takes no argument but gives a number btw 0 and 1
split function splits the given string into multiple elements containing LIST in which
each element Is seperated by the given input
Partition splits onnly the first occuring string inputted
in LIST INSERT operation the syntax is
list=[1,2,3,4,5]
list.insert(<index>,<element>)
example:
X=[2,3,45,6]
X.insert(56,10)
print(X)
ans:[2,3,45,6,10]
pop uses index value
X.pop(3)
print(X)
[2,3,45,10]
>>>t=(1,2,[3,4],5)
>>>t[2][1]=3.14
>>>print(t)
>>>(1,2,[3,3.14],5)
tup=("a","A","c")
max(tup)
c
because the ASKII value of "c" is greater than "a" and "A"
what are tokens they are the basic blocks of python for example
if is a token that is , "if" is a key word and a token
abc is a token ,abc is an identifier
l="Python"
l1=list(l)
print(l1)
["P","y","t","h","o","n"]
5+6+"True"-error
5+6+True=12
a,b=8,6 valid
a=b=9 valid
a=4;b=5 valid
a=4,b=5 not valid error(syntax error )
A=[1,2,3,4,5]
A.remove(<element>)
A=[1,2,3,5]
A.remove(A.index(3))
ans:[1,3,4,5]
functions: collection of statements used to perform a specific task
-built-in
len()
int()
type()
print()
id()
-function defined in module
-need to download the module
MATH MODULE
sin()
cos()
sqrt()
ceil()
floor()
fabs()
STATISTICS MODULE
mean()
median()
mode()
RANDOM MODULE
randint(a,b)
randrange(a,b)
random(<no parameter>)
-user-defined function
def a():
 <
 code block >
no of arguement shud be equal to number of parameter
SCOPE OF A VARIABLE:
scope of a variable is the portion of the program where it is recognised
-local scope
-global scope
positional arguement means assigning a variable in the calling statement and in the
function header....but default is specifying default values in the header
f=open("a.txt","w")
data=f.write("hello")
print(data)
#this print statement returns the number of characters written into the file
in text file the written thing should be a string datatype and not anyother datatype
write(string)#explicit back slash n needed for next line
for writelines we can use sequence datatype
f=open("a.txt","w")
data=f.writelines(["hello"])
print(data)
output: None
here also we cant use int we have to change to string and do it
f=open("a.txt","w")
f.writelines(["1","2"])
output:
12
without closing the file in text mode data will not be written it will be only in a temp
memory called buffer until u close the file
else use
f.flush()
with mode of opening a text file
with open("a.txt","r") as f:
 print(f.read())
automatically closes the file after the nested block of code
pickling/serialisation: process of converting a series of data into stream of bytes
before witing into the file(writing)
unpickling is opp(reading)
pickle.dump(a,f)-writing
pickle.load(f)-reading
loads only one record...use loop to extract full data
import pickle
rb wb ab.
important to use try except here because eof concept is not undertaken here
while reading or loading we have to use try except before
but try exxcpet will be used when we use while loop while loading

always remember to close the file if u are writing or reading data's into it to
permanently store it in
delimiter for csv is comma
import csv
reader object writer object
.csv
one record-<writer-object>.writerow()
multiple record-<writer-object>.writerows()
import csv
f=open("a.csv","w")
wo=csv.writer(f)
we.writerow(["a","b","c"])
while writing into a csv file always use newline=""
f=open("a.csv","w",newline="")
to avoid the unnecessary blank line
CAUTION:
while reading from csv we always get the output as a string data type:
if we input the data in terms of int also it will show as a string while reading, so we
have to explicitly covert them bakc into their own datatypes in order to check any
inequality
use
next(ro) # wher ro is reader object to avoid the heading which us given whule
checking for inequality
ex:
f=open("a.csv","r")
ro=csv.reader(f)
next(ro)
print(len(list(ro)))
f.close()
diff btw r+ and w+ is inorder to use r+ file must be existing but no such case in w+
NOTE:
in creatinng files with f=open()
f=open("mydata","w")
this takes the file as text file
that is if there is no extension the file is taken as a text file
INFO about binary files:
-information is stored the same format as info in memory
-no character tranlation takes place
-no delimiter/everylie doesnot end with newline char
-pickle module is used for reading and writing
in f.seek(offset,reference_point)
offset says the no of bytes to be moved
default value of reference point is zero
the use of newline in csv is EOL translation is suppressed
pickle.dump(<data>,<file_name>)
how are the file path stored??
example:
C:\Users\gvsri\Desktop\PYTHON_FILES
>>>a=b=0
>>>
#the above statement doesnot give any error
text.replace(<old_word>,<new_word>)
d={1:2,2:3,3:4}
print(d.items())
print(d.(keys))
print(d.values())
output:
dict_items([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])
dict_keys([1,2,3])
dict_values([2,3,4])
DATA STRUCTURE:
it represents how data is stored/organised in computer's memory
a mechanism to store organise and access data
STACK:LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE

TOPOLOGY
 art of aonnecting diff computers in a network
-BUS
 all nodes are connected to one main cable called backbone
ADV:
 easy to install
 cost effective
 failure of one node doesnt affect the network
DISADV:
 incase cable is fault entire network goes down
 at one time only one node can transmit data
-STAR
 each node directly connectede to a hub/switch
ADV:
 easy to detech faults
 one link fails network still functions
DISADV:
 failure of hub/switch crashes the entire network
 requires more cable length than bus topology
-TREE
 combination of bus and star topology
ADV:
 offers easy way of network expansion
 even if one network fails all others remain connected and works
